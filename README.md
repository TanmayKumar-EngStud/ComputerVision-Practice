# ComputerVision-Practice
This Repository holds all the programs that I am making while learning Computer vision
All the programs on which i worked are purely on OpenCV that's why this repository may look quite easy and not that important.
Purpose of this repository is to actually help me in revising the concept of OpenCV while i am working over an image processing and modelling.
